  <h1>Hi, my name is Ozan Onay.</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a software developer and programmer based in San Francisco.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Being a programmer means speaking to computers in languages we both understand
    (for me this is <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">Python</a>,
    <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">Ruby</a> and
    <a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/">JavaScript</a>).
    Being a software developer means programming in a way that is
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" rel="nofollow">effective</a>,
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" rel="nofollow">maintainable</a> and
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design" rel="nofollow">useful for humans</a>,
    usually alongside other software developers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I practice my craft as co-founder and VP of engineering at <a href="http://topguest.com">Topguest</a>.
    I'm afraid this means that I don't have time to do contract jobs for you,
    but it also means you should contact me if you're interested in working as a software developer
    at an exciting, fast-paced startup company.
