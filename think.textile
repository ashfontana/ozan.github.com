h1. {{ page.title }}

I intend for this to become a rationalist's toolkit and guide to better thinking. I will write it primarily to consolidate my thoughts on thinking and interrogate my use of certain mental models. For now, it is simply a list of resources.

h2. Steps

h3. Distinguish between thinking and knowing

Being "smart" conflates thinking (a skill) with knowing ()

h3. Be a pragmatist, make beliefs pay rent

h3. Learn how to doubt

h3. Consider why people say and do the things they say and do

h3. Identify and seek out scrutinizers

h3. Speak and write more clearly.

Why? Disciplined communication seems to lead to disciplined thought. If you communicate ineffectively, it will be difficult for others to scrutinize your thoughts.

How? Study http://www.ai.uga.edu/mc/WriteThinkLearn.pdf . Avoid ambiguity. Ask yourself "did this person understand exactly what I said"? If there was "a miscommunication", blame yourself and attempt to identify the source of the confusion. 

h3. Learn to identify the crutches of poor thinking

h3. Practice thinking by limiting non-thinking
