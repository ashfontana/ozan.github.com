This is a quick post to catch those who may be googling for more information about projects I discussed earlier today at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/sfpython/events/16514234/">an SF Python meetup</a>.

You can <a href="https://github.com/ozan/grunt">fork grunt on github</a>.

Yak is not yet open source but will be soon. If you are interested in working with/on Yak, please <a href="mailto:ozan.onay@gmail.com">get in touch with me</a>.
